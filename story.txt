This is bingyu's story. Long long ago, there is a princess...

The princess is very beautiful.This princess is only 8 years old.

She lived in a big castle with her mother and her father, the king and the queen. One day, they decided to go on vacation to Camelot. They left the guards in charge of life back at the castle.

The princess was very excited to meet King Arthur!  She wanted to try to hold the sword he had pulled from the stone.

She didn't know who she should ask to see the sword.  She was going to have tea with Queen Guinevere.  Maybe she could ask her.  Hopefully, she was an understanding Queen.  Girls love adventures too!

So she asked the queen then she started her adventure!
